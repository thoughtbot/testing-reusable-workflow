# testing-reusable-workflow

This is a test repo. Lots of tests. Merged a PR on templates, will the templates still work without the leading "/"? Nope, it won't.

Testing again: do we need the on.push.main? yes, we do.

but maybe with the on merge pr, it works as I want.

How to call the action only if merged? take 2.

Updating README with another thing.

## Current problems

- how to only run the workflow when the automatic PR to update the README is merged?
- how to handle the PAT token for the organization?

Updating README without changing the snippet and opening a PR - no action was run
Updating README changing the snippet and opening a PR -

<!-- START /templates/footer.md -->
<!-- END /templates/footer.md -->
