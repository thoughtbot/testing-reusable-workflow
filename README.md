# testing-reusable-workflow

This is a test repo. Lots of tests. Merged a PR on templates, will the templates still work without the leading "/"? Nope, it won't.

Testing again: do we need the on.push.main? yes, we do.

but maybe with the on merge pr, it works as I want.

How to call the action only if merged? take 2.

Updating README with another thing.
